# How-to-Visualize-Filters-and-Feature-Maps-in-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Neural network models are generally referred to as being opaque. This means that they are poor at explaining the reason why a specific decision or prediction was made.  Convolutional neural networks are designed to work with image data, and their structure and function suggest that should be less inscrutable than other types of neural networks.
